## 🔍 Overview

Keeping up with the volume of published machine learning research is a growing challenge — abstracts are dense, and manually filtering through hundreds of papers to find relevant ones is inefficient. This project addresses that by combining **semantic search**, **abstractive summarization**, and **topic modeling** into a single end-to-end pipeline.

Users can enter a natural-language query and instantly retrieve the most relevant research papers, each accompanied by an automatically generated summary and extracted keywords, along with a higher-level view of the research topic landscape.

---

## 💼 Problem Statement

Researchers, students, and practitioners routinely face the following challenges:

- Which papers, among thousands, are actually relevant to a specific research question?
- How can long abstracts be digested quickly without losing key information?
- What are the dominant research themes within a large paper corpus?

This project tackles all three by combining retrieval, summarization, and unsupervised topic discovery.

## 🛠 Key Techniques

### 1. Semantic Embedding Generation
- Papers converted into 384-dimensional dense vectors using **Sentence-BERT** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Captures semantic meaning beyond simple keyword matching

### 2. High-Speed Vector Search
- **FAISS** (`IndexFlatIP`) indexes all paper embeddings for sub-second similarity search
- Cosine similarity via normalized inner product

### 3. Abstractive Summarization
- Pretrained **BART** (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`) model condenses lengthy abstracts into concise summaries

### 4. Keyword & Keyphrase Extraction
- **KeyBERT** identifies the most representative terms/phrases from each abstract

### 5. Unified Query Pipeline
- A single `analyze_query()` function chains search → summarization → keyword extraction into one structured output

### 6. Topic Clustering & Visualization
- **KMeans** groups the corpus into distinct research themes
- **PCA** projects high-dimensional embeddings into 2D for visualization
- **WordCloud** highlights dominant terms across a set of results

## 📈 Results

| Component | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Semantic Search | Returns highly relevant papers for natural-language queries (validated via cosine similarity scores) |
| Summarization | Reduces abstracts to concise, readable summaries in seconds |
| Keyword Extraction | Surfaces accurate, topic-representative keyphrases per paper |
| Clustering | Identifies 8 distinct research themes across the corpus |

**Key Findings:**
- Semantic search consistently outperforms keyword-based matching for conceptually similar queries
- Clustering reveals clear topic boundaries (e.g., medical imaging, NLP, reinforcement learning) without any manual labeling
- Combining retrieval with summarization significantly reduces the time needed to evaluate paper relevance
